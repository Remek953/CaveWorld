Hello Adventurer. My name is Remek and this is my first project in Python: CaveWorld. 
    
This is the text game with RPG elements and ASCII graphic in Python.
The idea came up when I read "Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner" by Michael Dawson and 
I always love play the video games. That is why my first goal was to create a game.
Finally, after countless hours of watching tutorials, doing exercises at CodeWars.com 
and reading about Python, I started my first project.

I hope you will enjoy my game and I will be waiting for your feedback. :)
